## PR infomation
- Feel free to make bug fixes when you see something that isn't working or is missing:
    - If you're unsure how to fix something, ask for help with the code you're working on.
    - If you can't ask for help with an issue you've found in the source code, create an issue.
- If you want to do more than just bug fixes, I kindly ask that you talk with me on Discord first. **MAX (ltzmax)**
    - If you're unable to talk with me on Discord, create an issue, and we'll discuss it there.
- If you have a good idea for a new feature, please create an issue or talk with me on Discord:
    - I do love good new ideas, but I'm not sure if I'll accept them, so please create an issue or talk with me on Discord first to see if it's something I want.
